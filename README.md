# C Programming: Basic Programs

## Overview

This repository contains simple, beginner-level C programs designed to help new programmers practice fundamental C programming concepts. These programs demonstrate basic syntax, control structures, loops, and functions in C. They are perfect for anyone starting out with C and want to understand the core programming concepts.

### C Language
C is a general-purpose programming language that provides low-level access to memory and is known for its performance and efficiency. It is widely used in systems programming and embedded systems.

## Programs Included

This repository includes the following basic programs:

1. **Hello World (`hello_world.c`)**: A simple program that outputs "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. **Even or Odd Checker (`even_odd.c`)**: A program that checks whether a given number is even or odd.
3. **Prime Number Checker (`prime_checker.c`)**: A program that checks if a number is prime.
4. **Factorial Program (`factorial.c`)**: A program that calculates the factorial of a given number using both loops and recursion.
5. **Fibonacci Series (`fibonacci.c`)**: A program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number.

Each program is self-contained and demonstrates a basic concept in C.

## Features

- **Educational**: These programs are great for beginners learning the syntax and basic features of C.
- **Simple & Easy to Understand**: Each program is focused on a single concept and is written in a simple, easy-to-follow style.
- **Modular**: Each program is small and focuses on demonstrating one specific concept.

## Prerequisites

To run these programs, you will need:

- A C compiler (e.g., **GCC** or **Clang**)
- Basic understanding of C programming concepts such as variables, loops, and conditionals.
